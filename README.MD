# Boggle

## [Deployed Application](https://boggle-yonilurie.netlify.app/)

The game of boggle.

With a three minute time limit, find the most amount of words! Words must be made of adjacent characters, and each character may only be used one per word.

## Definitions

After the game is completed, all the users guessed will be shown, as well as all of the possible words that could be formed. Clicking on a word will call the [Free Dictionary API](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI) created by [meetDeveloper](https://github.com/meetDeveloper), and return a definition.
